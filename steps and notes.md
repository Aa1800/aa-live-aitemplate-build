#Setup Ruff using the below prompt
Using the official Ruff documentation as context, let's set up Ruff for our project optimized for AI self-correction.

Documentation to read: FETCH:(https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/)
Read and understand the configuration options before continuing.

Don't set up anything beyond Ruff.

Write a simple Python script in main.py then test our Ruff setup when done.

#ToDo
Ruff did not add all instructions - refer to the github file later and see if we need anything else to be added, or if we need to update something on the process
